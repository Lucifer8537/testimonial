            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honesty feel I
            got every penny's worth.

              had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
              course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
              life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched
              careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</q

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.

            >Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
            progreamming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
            program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
            were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
            agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
            learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
            have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
            example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a
            job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
            recommended!</q
